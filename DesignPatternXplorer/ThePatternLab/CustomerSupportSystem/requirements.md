Real-time scenario question to test your understanding of design patterns:

---

**Scenario:**

You are building a customer support system for a SaaS company. 

Users can raise support tickets through a web portal. 
These tickets can be of different typesâ€”technical issue, billing issue, feature request, or general inquiry.

Each type of ticket may need to be handled by different departments
(e.g., technical team, billing team, product team, or customer service).

However, the system should be flexible enough so that if a ticket cannot be handled by the first department 

it is sent to, it should be passed along to the next appropriate department in line until it's resolved.

Additionally, the system should allow for the possibility that new departments may be added in the future without changing existing code logic.
